# Depend on Transformer Lens

This is the start of an attempt to include [Transformer Lens](https://neelnanda-io.github.io/TransformerLens/) in this project, to 
be used to populate weights and validate implementation.
On hold for now as clean install using conda (recommended for PythonCall) or pip (supported by PythonCall) was more difficult than expected. 
Next step is probably a manual install of pytorch first, or duplicating versions from colaboratory.
